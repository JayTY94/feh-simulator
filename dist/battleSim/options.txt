GENERAL NOTES ON OPTIONS:
- All options have default values, remove ones you aren't using for a cleaner input file
- Options are based on the exact text before and after the =, so add any character (such as #) before an option 
	to conveniently disable it
- Options are case-sensitive

CHALLENGERS: A comma-separated list of hero names to run this analysis on
- Use 'allheroes' instead of a name to run this analysis on all heroes
- For a complete list of hero names, see heroes.py (or the duel results)
challengers = Azura (PA),Inigo (PA),Olivia (PA),Shigure (PA)

BOON/BANE: Replace these with any stat name (hp/atk/spd/def/res/none)
boon = none
bane = none

RARITY: Replace with a rarity value (1-5 are officially supported)
- Skillsets may behave unexpectedly for a hero/rarity combination that doesn't exist
rarity = 5
enemyrarity = 5

MERGE: Replace this with a numerical merge value (1-10 are officially supported)
#merge = 10
#enemymerge = 10

SUPPORT: Specify a C/B/A/S value to apply that summoner support bonus to the challenger
#support = S

SKILLSET: Replace these with any skill name (will be reset to default if invalid)
- For a complete list of skill names, see skills.py
#A = Triangle Adept 3
#B = Windsweep 3
#C = Spur Spd 3
#S = Phantom Spd 1
#Special = Growing Thunder
#Weapon = Wo Dao

DAMAGE TAKEN: Replace this with any numerical value - if higher than the unit's HP, unit will start at 1 HP
#damage = 25
#enemydamage = 6

PRECHARGE: Precharge value for unit's special (if higher than charge required, special will start ready to activate)
#precharge = 5
#enemyprecharge = 72

OUTPUT STYLE:
- "Verbose": Show full text of each duel
- "Summary": Show victor/rounds/overkill for each duel
- "Totals": Show only total stats
- "CompareBuilds": Show comparison of results for different skillsets (see additional options below)
output = Verbose

OUTPUT FILE:
- Set a file name here to print all output to it, otherwise all output will be printed to the console
outputfile = output.txt

STATS: Comma-separated list of total stats to display for each scenario
- "Wins": Cases where the challenger defeats a foe utterly
- "Losses": Cases where the challenger is defeated utterly
- "Inconclusive": Cases where both the challenger and the enemy survive the specified rounds
- "Damage Dealt": Damage dealt by the challenger (technically, net damage taken by the enemy)
- "Damage Taken": Net damage taken by the challenger
- "Damage Ratio": Ratio between damage dealt and damage taken
- Note that damage values do not include overkill
stats = Wins,Losses,Inconclusive,Damage Dealt,Damage Taken,Damage Ratio

SCENARIOS: Different combinations of round initiations to analyze
- Each scenario can be listed as a combination of "C" and "E"
- A "C" indicates a round that the challenger initiates
- An "E" indicates a round that the enemy initiates
scenarios = CECECE,ECECEC

COMBAT MODE: Style of combat to use (defaults to 'duel')
- "duel": Each battle is independent
- "gauntlet": Challenger's state after each battle they win carries over to the next
combatmode = duel
- When using Gauntlet mode, the order of the enemy list is shuffled for more representative results.
- To ensure a consistent ordering of enemies across multiple tests, set a shuffleseed value (it can be anything)
#shuffleseed = MagicIsEverything

ENEMY FILTERS: Mark any category as 'exclude' to exclude units of that type
melee = include
ranged = include
red = include
blue = include
green = include
gray = include
physical = include
magical = include
infantry = include
cavalry = include
flying = include
armored = include
staff = exclude
nonstaff = include

THREATEN/PLOY EFFECT: Who threatens and ploys affect on the first turn (Both/Neither/Attacker/Defender)
#threatenrule = Both

PLOY BEHAVIOR: Whether ranged attackers will attack diagonally to dodge ploys (Diagonal/Orthogonal)
#ployangle = Orthogonal

GALEFORCE: Whether to initiate again if Galeforce triggers
usegaleforce = True

ENEMY SKILLSET DEFAULTS: Enemies will gain these skills if they have no skill in the specified slot
#defaultA = Fury 3
#defaultB = Quick Riposte 3
#defaultC = Threaten Spd 3
#defaultS = Quickened Pulse
#defaultSpecial = Moonbow
#defaultWeapon = Dire Thunder

ENEMY SKILLSET OVERRIDES: Enemies will gain these skills (if valid) even if they already have a skill in the specified slot
#overrideA = Fury 3
#overrideB = Quick Riposte 3
#overrideC = Threaten Spd 3
#overrideS = Quickened Pulse
#overrideSpecial = Moonbow
#overrideWeapon = Brave Bow+

CUSTOM ENEMY LISTS:
- "usecustomenemylist": A filepath for a custom enemy list
#usecustomenemylist = seasons18-24arenadata.txt
- "customenemylistformat": The format of the custom enemy list
- "Names": One hero name per line (repeated entries will be ignored)
- "Builds": Builds of the format ID,NAME,BOON,BANE,MERGE,A,B,C,S,SPECIAL,WEAPON
- IDs must be unique, but names do not have to be (so multiple builds for a unit can be included)
- "Legacy": An exported custom enemy list from the original mass duel simulator
- Note that the star symbol from legacy lists should be replaced with "*"
customenemylistformat = Legacy

BUFFS: Buff values for each stat
#atkbuff = 6
#spdbuff = 6
#defbuff = 0
#resbuff = 0
#enemyatkbuff = 2
#enemyspdbuff = 2
#enemydefbuff = 2
#enemyresbuff = 2

DEBUFFS: Debuff values for each stat
#atkdebuff = -3
#spddebuff = -3
#defdebuff = -3
#resdebuff = -3
#enemyatkdebuff = -1
#enemyspddebuff = -1
#enemydefdebuff = -1
#enemyresdebuff = -1

SPURS: Spur values for each stat
#atkspur = 4
#spdspur = 4
#defspur = 4
#resspur = 4
#enemyatkspur = 3
#enemyspdspur = 3
#enemydefspur = 3
#enemyresspur = 3

ADJACENT ALLIES: By default, weapons that rely on adjacent allies will appear weaker than they often are because there are no adjacent allies.
To adjust this, set this value to a chosen number of adjacent allies.
adjacentallies = 1

COMPAREBUILDS OPTIONS:
- "comparebuildsslots" = skill slots to iterate through (separated by commas)
- Note that setting more than one or two slots here will take a long time
- Set this to "consecutive" to evaluate options for each stat slot individually, followed by an evaluation across all slots with the top skills from the individual slot results
- Set this to "consecutive-slot1-slot2" to evaluate options for each stat slot other than the named slots (consecutive-weapon will always keep the current weapon, for example)
comparebuildsslots = consecutive-weapon-c
- "comparebuildsstatformat" = How to display and evaluate builds
	- "StatTotalAcrossScenarios": Calculate one stat, use the sum across scenarios as sort value
comparebuildsstatformat = StatTotalAcrossScenarios
- "comparebuildstopskills" = Number of skills from each slot to use for the final evaluation if running a 'consecutive' CompareBuilds
- The default is 4; the final evaluation can take a very long time if it's much larger
comparebuildstopskills = 6
- "comparebuildsresultslimit" = Number of top builds to display
comparebuildsresultslimit = 100
- "exportbuilds" = Number of top builds to print in a format to use in a custom enemy list
exportbuilds = 10
- "comparebuildsoutputformat" = How to display output for CompareBuilds analysis
	- "complete": Show progress and results
	- "results": Show results only
	- "exportsonly": Only output builds in export format
comparebuildsoutputformat = complete
