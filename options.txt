OUTPUT STYLE:
- "Verbose": Show full text of each duel
- "Summary": Show victor/rounds/overkill for each duel
- "Totals": Show only total stats
- "CompareBuilds": Show comparison of results for different skillsets (see additional options below)
output = CompareBuilds

STATS: Comma-separated list of total stats to display for each scenario
- "Wins": Cases where the challenger defeats a foe utterly
- "Losses": Cases where the challenger is defeated utterly
- "Inconclusive": Cases where both the challenger and the enemy survive the specified rounds
stats = Wins,Losses,Inconclusive

SCENARIOS: Different combinations of round initiations to analyze
- Each scenario can be listed as a combination of "C" and "E"
- A "C" indicates a round that the challenger initiates
- An "E" indicates a round that the enemy initiates
scenarios = CECE,ECEC,C,E

ENEMY SKILLSET DEFAULTS: Enemies will gain these skills if they have no skill in the specified slot
defaultA = Fury 3
defaultB = Quick Riposte 3
defaultC = Threaten Spd 3
defaultS = Quickened Pulse
defaultSpecial = Moonbow
defaultWeapon = Dire Thunder

ENEMY SKILLSET OVERRIDES: Enemies will gain these skills (if valid) even if they already have a skill in the specified slot
overrideA = Fury 3
overrideB = Quick Riposte 3
overrideC = Threaten Spd 3
overrideS = Quickened Pulse
overrideSpecial = Moonbow
overrideWeapon = Brave Bow+

ADJACENT ALLIES: By default, owl tomes will appear weaker than other tomes because there are no nearby allies.
To adjust this, set this value to a chosen number of adjacent allies.
adjacentallies = 0

COMPAREBUILDS OPTIONS:
- "comparebuildsslots" = skill slots to iterate through (separated by commas)
- Note that setting more than one or two slots here will take a long time
- Set this to "consecutive" to evaluate options for each stat slot individually, followed by an evaluation across all slots with the top skills from the individual slot results
- Set this to "consecutive-slot1-slot2" to evaluate options for each stat slot other than the named slots (consecutive-weapon will always keep the current weapon, for example)
comparebuildsslots = consecutive-weapon-c
- "comparebuildsstatformat" = How to display and evaluate builds
	- "StatTotalAcrossScenarios": Calculate one stat, use the sum across scenarios as sort value
comparebuildsstatformat = StatTotalAcrossScenarios
- "comparebuildstopskills" = Number of skills from each slot to use for the final evaluation if running a 'consecutive' CompareBuilds
- The default is 4; the final evaluation can take a very long time if it's much larger
comparebuildstopskills = 6
